# gegl-HDR-ColorMapper
Chromaticity mapping algorithm for range compression or contrast adjustment.

I'm the reporter of https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gegl/-/issues/171 that ended up in a native blending-based (native) saturation approach.
And I also published some code that lead Gimp to implement the Lightness Blend mode https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=753163.
